In a **monolithic architecture**, the entire system is built as a single unit. The application’s various components, such as the user interface, business logic, and data access layers, are tightly integrated and interdependent. While this approach is simpler to manage in the early stages, it becomes more complex as the application grows. Below are several architectural patterns used in monolithic applications, each with different philosophies for organizing code:

### 1. **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**

**Pattern Overview:**
- **Model:** Represents the application's data and business logic. This layer handles data processing, validation, and interactions with the database.
- **View:** Represents the user interface (UI). The view displays data provided by the model in a format that the user can interact with.
- **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It receives user input from the view, processes it (with the help of the model), and returns the output to the view.

**When to Use:**
- It's best suited for web applications or any application with user interaction that needs clear separation between business logic, user interface, and control flow.
- Examples: Web applications using frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Django (Python), or Laravel (PHP).

### 2. **Layered (N-tier) Architecture**

**Pattern Overview:**
- In this pattern, the application is divided into distinct layers, each responsible for specific functionality. Common layers include:
  - **Presentation Layer (UI):** Responsible for displaying information to the user and capturing user input.
  - **Business Logic Layer (BLL) / Service Layer:** Handles the core functionality of the application. It processes business rules and performs logic.
  - **Data Access Layer (DAL):** Interacts with the database or external storage systems, abstracting data persistence.
  - **Infrastructure Layer:** Provides cross-cutting concerns such as logging, caching, and security.

**When to Use:**
- This is a good choice when scalability and maintainability are needed, and each layer can be worked on independently.
- It’s also used when separating concerns is crucial, as layers can be swapped out for others if necessary.

### 3. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**

**Pattern Overview:**
- **DDD** focuses on creating a model based on the business domain and aligning the software design with the domain’s structure and behavior.
- **Core Components of DDD:**
  - **Entities:** Objects with a distinct identity and lifecycle.
  - **Value Objects:** Immutable objects that represent a descriptive aspect of the domain (e.g., a "Date" object).
  - **Aggregates:** A group of related entities treated as a single unit of consistency.
  - **Repositories:** Used to access aggregates.
  - **Services:** Domain logic that doesn’t naturally fit into an entity or value object.
  - **Bounded Contexts:** Define the boundaries in which a particular model applies and ensures no ambiguity between models.

**When to Use:**
- Ideal for complex business domains that require clear, well-defined models and a deep focus on domain rules.
- It’s useful in large-scale enterprise applications where the domain model evolves with the business.
  
**Key Characteristics:**
- Encourages collaboration with domain experts to model the system's core.
- Helps create a shared understanding of the business domain.

### 4. **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)**

**Pattern Overview:**
- The **Hexagonal Architecture**, or **Ports and Adapters**, focuses on the separation of concerns by dividing the application into a core (business logic) and outer layers (infrastructure or external interfaces). The core is isolated from external systems like databases, user interfaces, or third-party services.
- **Core (Application Layer):** Contains the business logic and domain-specific rules.
- **Ports:** Interfaces through which external systems communicate with the core. For example, a port could be an interface to communicate with a database.
- **Adapters:** Concrete implementations of the ports. An adapter could be a database or an API client that implements the port's interface.

**When to Use:**
- Useful for applications that need to interact with multiple external systems, as it decouples the core business logic from the infrastructure.
- When there’s a need for flexibility in adding or replacing components without affecting the core logic.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Easy to test: Core logic can be tested in isolation.
- Provides flexibility for evolving infrastructure or user interfaces without modifying the core application.

### 5. **Clean Architecture**

**Pattern Overview:**
- **Clean Architecture** was coined by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) and is similar to the **Hexagonal Architecture** in some respects, but it focuses on the organization of code into concentric layers:
  - **Entities:** Represents the core business logic and models, independent of external systems.
  - **Use Cases / Application Layer:** Contains application-specific business rules, which orchestrate how data flows between the user interface and the core entities.
  - **Interface Adapters:** Acts as a bridge between the application and external systems, like databases, web servers, or user interfaces.
  - **Frameworks and Drivers (Outer Layer):** Contains external frameworks like web servers, databases, and third-party APIs.

**When to Use:**
- Best used when maintaining the independence of business logic and ensuring that changes to external systems (UI, DB) do not impact core functionality.
- It’s a good fit for applications that evolve over time, ensuring that business logic remains stable while infrastructure can change.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Promotes high maintainability and testability by isolating core logic from external concerns.
- Facilitates long-term flexibility and easy adaptation to new requirements.

### Other Architectural Patterns in Monolithic Applications:

#### 6. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** (Monolithic variant)
- While SOA is typically associated with distributed systems, the principles can also be applied in a monolithic context.
- **SOA** involves breaking the application into services that interact with each other, but within the same codebase. It can help decouple parts of the monolith for better modularity.
  
#### 7. **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**
- In an **event-driven** monolithic system, components communicate by emitting and consuming events, reducing direct dependencies between modules.
- Events may represent state changes or actions that trigger other operations.

**When to Use:**
- Suitable when the system needs to react to certain actions or states across different components (e.g., in an e-commerce platform where inventory updates need to propagate to order management).

| **Hexagonal**        | Separates the core from infrastructure via ports & adapters. | Systems interacting with various external systems.        |
| **Clean Architecture** | Emphasizes separation of concerns with concentric layers. | Large applications requiring maintainable and testable architecture. |
| **SOA**              | Breaks the system into loosely coupled services.        | Large applications that require modularity.               |

Each of these patterns serves different needs, but in a monolithic application, **Layered Architecture**, **MVC**, and **Clean Architecture** are among the most common choices for maintaining a structured and scalable system.
